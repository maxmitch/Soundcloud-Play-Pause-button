Soundcloud-Play-Pause-button
============================

This is a little bit of code that I created to make a little "Pause/Play" player out of sound cloud.

See example: http://tragicclothing.co.uk/soundcloud-player.php

So first off put inside your <head>:

<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script> //
